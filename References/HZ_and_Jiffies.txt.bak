HZ and Jiffies: -
--------------------
HZ is the number of times jiffies is incremented in one second. Each increment is called a tick.

Jiffies is incremented HZ times every second. If HZ = 1000, then it is incremented 1000 times 
(that is, one tick every 1/1,000 seconds). 

Example: - If HZ = 1000, then
 
	(Current jiffies - prev jiffies) = HZ or 1000, represents 1 second.
	
Similarly, if (Current jiffies - prev jiffies) = HZ/2, then it means 500ms.

Using the jiffies Counter : -
--------------------------

#include <linux/jiffies.h>
int time_after(unsigned long a, unsigned long b);
int time_before(unsigned long a, unsigned long b);
int time_after_eq(unsigned long a, unsigned long b);
int time_before_eq(unsigned long a, unsigned long b);

The first evaluates true when a, as a snapshot of jiffies, represents a time after b, the second evaluates true when time a is before time b, and the last two compare for âafter or equalâ and âbefore or equal.â
