uevent
==========
uevent is event-based, so there is no polling. Triggering uevent happened in many
cases and I would rather start with figuring out what uevent types are exist?

File: - include/linux/kobject.h

enum kobject_action {
    KOBJ_ADD,
    KOBJ_REMOVE,
    KOBJ_CHANGE,
    KOBJ_MOVE,
    KOBJ_ONLINE,
    KOBJ_OFFLINE,
    KOBJ_MAX
};

So it's

Add event
Remove event
Change event
Move event
Online event
Offline event
KOBJ_MAX is special and marks and of enum.

There are 2 functions that actually sends uevent - kobject_uevent and kobject_uevent_env.
These functions are called with on of the actions listed above.

Finally, to answer your questions. There are no predefined cases that will trigger uevent.
If you search for calls of kobject_uevent and kobject_uevent_env you will see that it's happens
in various callbacks in different unrelated kernel subsystems.
