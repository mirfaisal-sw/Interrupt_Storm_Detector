HZ and Jiffies: -
--------------------
HZ is the number of times jiffies is incremented in one second. Each increment is called a tick.

Jiffies is incremented HZ times every second. If HZ = 1,000, then it is incremented 1,000 times 
(that is, one tick every 1/1,000 seconds). 

Example: - If HZ = 1000, then
 
	(Current jiffies - prev jiffies) = HZ or 1000, represents 1 second.
	
Similarly, if (Current jiffies - prev jiffies) = HZ/2, then it means 500ms.
