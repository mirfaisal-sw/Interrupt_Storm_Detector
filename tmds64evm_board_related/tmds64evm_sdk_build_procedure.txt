SDK Installer download link: -
--------------------------------
https://www.ti.com/tool/PROCESSOR-SDK-AM64X

Procedure: -
------------
chmod +x ./ti-processor-sdk-linux-am64xx-evm-<version>-Linux-x86-Install.bin
./ti-processor-sdk-linux-am64xx-evm-<version>-Linux-x86-Install.bin

Directory structure: -
-------------------------
• bin - Contains the helper scripts for configuring the host system and target device. Most of these scripts are used by the setup.sh script.
• board-support - Contains the SDK components that need to be modified when porting to a custom platform. This includes the kernel and boot loaders as well as any out of tree drivers.
• docs - Contains various SDK documentation such as the software manifest and additional user’s guide. This is also the location where you can find the training directory with the device training materials.
• example-applications - Contains the sources for the TI provided example applications seen during the out-of-box demonstration.
• filesystem - Contains the reference file systems. These include the smaller base file system as well as the full-featured SDK file system.
• linux-devkit - Contains the cross-compile toolchain and libraries to speed development for the target device.
• Makefile - Provides build targets for many of the SDK components from the top-level of the SDK.
• Rules.make - Sets default values used by the top-level Makefile as well as sub-component Makefiles.
• setup.sh - Configures the users host system as well as the target system for development.

Building kernel: -
=========================

Path of linux kernel in installed SDK -
/home/mir/My_Workspace/TMDS64EVM/TMDS64EVM_SDK_Install/SDK_Install_Path/board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.1.46+gitAUTOINC+247b2535b2-g247b2535b2

# export PATH=<sdk path>/linux-devkit/sysroots/x86_64-arago-linux/usr/bin:$PATH

export PATH=/home/mir/My_Workspace/Cross_Compiler/arm-gnu-toolchain-11.3.rel1-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu/bin:$PATH

# make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- distclean

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- defconfig

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- defconfig ti_am64x_pcie_rc.config

Or

# make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- tisdk_am64xx-evm_defconfig

## To customize run menuconfig
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- menuconfig

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- Image

## AM64x EVM -> k3-am642-evm.dts
make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- ti/k3-am642-evm.dtb
# make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- dtbs

make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-none-linux-gnu- modules


## Installing the kernel to SD card

cd /home/mir/My_Workspace/TMDS64EVM/TMDS64EVM_SDK_Install/SDK_Install_Path/board-support/ti-linux-kernel-6.1.46+gitAUTOINC+247b2535b2-g247b2535b2

mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image /mnt/boot
sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am642-evm.dtb /mnt/boot/dtb/ti
sudo make ARCH=arm64 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/mnt modules_install

Note: - 
Append INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 to the make modules_install command to reduce the size of the resulting installation
