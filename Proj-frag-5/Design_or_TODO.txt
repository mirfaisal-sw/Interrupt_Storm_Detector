Design or TODO lkm link list: - 
=====================================

We can create node of link list having members as below:-

1. Create node of list as below -

#include <linux/list.h>

struct my_irq_data {

    int irq_number;
    struct irq_desc *desc;
    float time_stamp_us;
    //....
	struct list_head irq_timestamp_list ;
};

2. Kernel developers only implement circular doubly linked lists because this
structure allows us to implement FIFO and LIFO, and kernel developers take care to
maintain a minimal set of code. 

3. Create linked list

Note : - struct list_head is defined in kernel as 

struct list_head is defined in include/linux/types.h as:

struct list_head{
    list_head *next, *prev;
};

It is core data structure to implement list in kernel.
