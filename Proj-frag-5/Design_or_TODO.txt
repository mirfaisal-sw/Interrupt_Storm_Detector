Design or TODO lkm link list: - 
=====================================

We can create node of link list having members as below:-

1. Kernel developers only implement circular doubly linked lists because this
structure allows us to implement FIFO and LIFO, and kernel developers take care to
maintain a minimal set of code. 

struct list_head is defined in kernel as 

struct list_head{
    list_head *next, *prev;
};

It is core data structure to implement list in kernel.


2. Create node of list as below -
---------------------------------------

In the world of the kernel, before a data structure can be represented as 
a linked list, that structure must embed a struct list_head field.

#include <linux/list.h>

struct mirq_data {

    int irq_number;
	char *irq_name;
    struct irq_desc *desc;
    float time_stamp_us;
    //....
	struct list_head irq_data_list ;
};

To initialize list member of a node, we use INIT_LIST_HEAD() API

The following is the expansion of INIT_LIST_HEAD:
static inline void INIT_LIST_HEAD(struct list_head *list)
{
	list->next = list;
	list->prev = list;
}

3. Creating or initializing a list:-
------------------------------------------
We need to create a struct list_head variable that will always point to the head
(first element) of our list. This instance of list_head is not associated to any node and is
special:

static LIST_HEAD(mirq_list_head);

Now, we can create mirq_data nodes and add them to our list, mirq_list_head:

	#include <linux/list.h>
	struct mirq_data *mirq_x = kmalloc(sizeof(*mirq_x), GFP_KERNEL);
	struct mirq_data *mirq_y = kmalloc(sizeof(*mirq_y), GFP_KERNEL);

	/* Initialize each node's list entry */
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&mirq_x->irq_data_list);
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&mirq_y->irq_data_list);

	/*Fill every field of mirq_data.*/
	mirq_x->irq_number = 100;
	mirq_y->irq_number = 110;
	list_add(&mirq_x->irq_data_list, &mirq_list_head);
	list_add(&mirq_y->irq_data_list, &mirq_list_head);
	
	
Now, mirq_list_head contains two nodes.

4. Adding a list node: -
-------------------------

The kernel provides list_add() to add a new entry to the list, which is a wrapper around
the internal function __list_add:

void list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *head);

static inline void list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *head)
{
	__list_add(new, head, head->next);
}

__list_add will take two known entries as a parameter, and inserts your elements
between them. Its implementation in the kernel is quite easy:

static inline void __list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *prev,
		struct list_head *next)
{
	next->prev = new;
	new->next = next;
	new->prev = prev;
	prev->next = new;
}

list_add() API adds a node at the top, so it is used to implement a stack.
list_add_tail() API adds a node at the end of a list, so it can be used to implement
a FIFO or queue.

5. Deleting a node from the list: - 
-------------------------------------
List handling is an easy task in kernel code. Deleting a node is straightforward:
	void list_del(struct list_head *entry);

Following the preceding example, let's delete the mirq_x node:
list_del(&mirq_x->irq_data_list);

list_del disconnects the prev and next pointers of the given entry,
resulting in entry removal. The memory allocated for the node is not freed yet; we
need to do that manually with kfree.

6. Linked list traversal: - 
-------------------------------------
We have the macro list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member) for list traversal:
	-> head is the list's head node.
	-> member is the name of the struct list_head list within our data struct 
	-> pos is used for iteration. It is a loop cursor (just like i in for(i=0; i<foo;
		i++)). head could be the head node of the linked list, or any entry, and we don't
		care since we are dealing with a doubly linked list:
		
	struct mirq_data *amirq; /* loop counter */
	
	/* 'list' is the name of the list_head struct in our data structure */
	list_for_each_entry(amirq, mirq_list_head, irq_data_list){
		pr_alert("DBG: IRQ name: %s\n", amirq->irq_name);
	}
